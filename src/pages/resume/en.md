## Recent Work Experience

### [Jinshuju](https://jinshuju.net/)

#### Engineering Manager | August 2021 - August 2024

Key product development projects:

- Frontend-backend separation of the core website. As Tech Lead, I led a 12-person development team, spearheaded system design, and managed the project's full lifecycle. We separated complex modules including the form editor, data pages, and public form pages, significantly improving user experience and development efficiency.
- Led the development of Jinshuju Portal, a brand-new system module. Within two months, we built the system from scratch, developing custom portal components, customer login/registration, and completion rate statistics modules. Post-launch, the system maintained a 99.98% SLA.
- Played a core development role in Jinshuju Exam, a new product. Completed complex interactive features including preview, multiple core business components, and the official website. Also contributed to performance improvements, reducing complex page transition times to under 1 second. Additionally, participated in optimizing exam question generation prompts, improving output quality stability for one-sentence question generation scenarios.

In team management, I was responsible for recruiting the development team and fostering personal growth within the development track. During this period, I recruited about 15 people and trained 2 Tech Leads capable of leading development teams.

In frontend technology, our team continuously explored new industry technologies to improve work efficiency, such as introducing Vite into create-react-app. We also resolved complex frontend-related issues.

#### Senior Software Engineer | February 2021 - July 2021

- Developed the customer attribute grid in Jinshuju's customer management module, with technical highlights including the use of ag-grid and generic component interface design.
- Developed an exam anti-cheating feature, integrating this new functionality into the complex public form module using browser APIs and React hooks.

### [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com/)

#### Senior Software Engineer | June 2019 - January 2021

Led micro-frontend architecture design and development, as well as internal development framework creation and promotion for a leading domestic cloud vendor.

As Tech Lead, I liaised with clients from initial collaboration direction-setting to delivery and launch, promoting the solution across 20+ business units.

In micro-frontend architecture design, we implemented a framework-agnostic solution using HTML imports combined with micro-application lifecycle design. We also optimized first-screen performance for the Angular ecosystem and designed end-to-end CI/CD processes.

Later, I was deeply involved in the development and promotion of a proprietary Angular business framework, writing codemods to assist with programmatic code changes. After implementing this framework, security upgrades that previously took 1 month could be completed in 1 day.

### [Modao](https://modao.cc/)

#### Frontend Engineer | February 2015 - May 2019

As an early core engineer, responsible for developing multiple key projects from scratch, including:

- Led frontend-backend separation architecture refactoring, significantly improving development efficiency and user experience
- Designed and developed Modao Sketch plugin, enabling seamless conversion from design drafts to prototypes
- Built enterprise version statistics and analysis module, introducing InfluxDB for recording user operations, using BizCharts for interactive visualization on the frontend
- Rewrote mobile application using React Native, achieving one-time development for simultaneous delivery on iOS, Android, and mobile web platforms
- Optimized private deployment solution: Leveraged JRuby and Warbler, combined with Ruby on Rails monkey patching techniques, to harden code and enhance asset security
