## Work Experience

### [Jinshuju](https://jinshuju.net/)

#### Engineering Manager | August 2021 - August 2024

In product development, I mainly experienced the following projects:

- Front-end and back-end separation of the core website. As tech lead, I led a development team of 12 people, spearheaded system design, and managed the project's full lifecycle. We separated the front-end and back-end for complex modules including the form editor, data pages, and public form pages, significantly improving user experience and development efficiency.
- Led the development of Jinshuju Portal, a completely new system module. Within two months, we completed the system from scratch, developing custom portal components, customer login and registration, completion rate statistics, and other modules. After launch, the system SLA maintained at 99.98%.
- Participated as a core developer in the development of Jinshuju Exam, a new product. Mainly completed preview functionality, multiple core business components, and the official website, all with complex interactions. Also contributed to performance improvements in page switching, achieving switch times within 1s for complex pages. Additionally, participated in prompt optimization for exam question generation, improving the stability of output quality in one-sentence question generation scenarios to some extent.

In team management, I was responsible for recruiting the development team and personal growth in the development sequence. During this period, I recruited about 15 people and nurtured 2 tech leads capable of leading development teams.

In front-end technology, we continuously experimented with new industry technologies to improve work efficiency, such as introducing Vite into create-react-app. We also solved various complex front-end related issues.

#### Senior Software Engineer | February 2021 - July 2021

- Responsible for the development of the customer attribute grid in Jinshuju's customer management module. Technical highlights include using ag-grid and designing generic component interfaces.
- Developed exam anti-cheating functionality, incorporating this new feature into the complex public form module using browser APIs and React hooks.

#### Senior Software Engineer | June 2019 - January 2021

Led the micro-frontend architecture design and development for a leading domestic cloud vendor, as well as the development and promotion of internal development frameworks.

In micro-frontend architecture design, we achieved a framework-agnostic micro-frontend architecture using html-import combined with micro-application lifecycle design. Also, we performed first-screen performance optimization and end-to-end CI/CD design for the Angular ecosystem.
